# Description

### List of all the notebooks

- **`algorithm_comparison.ipynb`**  
This notebook aims to compare the most classical machine learning supervised classification algorithm of scikit-learn on a fixed set of feature, to perform artefact vs somatic mutations classification.

- **`feature_engineering.ipynb`**  
This notebook aims to compare different set of features (without a group, new features, ...) with a given algorithm (GradientBoosting), to perform artefact vs somatic mutations classification.

- **`feature_engineering-RF.ipynb`**  
This notebook aims to compare different set of features (without a group, new features, ...) with a given algorithm (GradientBoosting), to perform artefact vs somatic mutations classification.

- **`groupfold_cross_validation.ipynb`**  
This notebook aims to perform rigorous cross-validation by testing the model (fixed algorithm, fixed set of features) on mutations (or patients) that have never been seen in the training set, and then compare the performance differences with a basic cross-validation.

- **`final_algorithm_comparison.ipynb`** 
This notebook aims to compare the most classical machine learning supervised classification algorithm of scikit-learn on the best set of features found, to perform artefact vs somatic mutations classification.

- **`sorted_sampling_issue.ipynb`**  
⚠️ This notebook is drafty and has not been cleaned. It aims to compare the performance of the algorithms on a sorted vs unsorted original dataset.
