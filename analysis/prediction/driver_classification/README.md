# Description

### List of all the notebooks

- **`algorithm_comparison.ipynb`**  
This notebook aims to compare the most classical machine learning supervised classification algorithm of scikit-learn on a fixed set of feature, to perform driver vs passenger mutations classification.

- **`feature_engineering-RF.ipynb`**  
This notebook aims to compare different set of features (without a group, new features, ...) with a given algorithm (Random Forest), to perform driver vs passenger mutations classification.

- **`groupfold_cross_validation.ipynb`**  
This notebook aims to perform rigorous cross-validation by testing the model (fixed algorithm, fixed set of features) on mutations (or patients) that have never been seen in the training set, and then compare the performance differences with a basic cross-validation.
