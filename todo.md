# todo list

## Git
- [x] test the GitHub links
- [x] test the main `README.md` cloning link
- [x] rename repository
- [x] clean `todo.md` list
- [ ] specify `ssh-add` is necessary for anyone to use `selene_job.ipy`
- [ ] add instructions to download processed data?




## Final clean
- [ ] sort `temp/` folder
- [ ] comment all `prediction/` notebooks




## Machine Learning

### Sampling and cross-validation
- [ ] inconsistent sorted vs shuffle results
- [ ] optimise undersampling/oversampling (imblearn technics)

### Other
- [ ] errors only appearing in detailed CV
- [x] try 3-base change feature
- [ ] try features like (BioC)
    - genome mappability
    - repeat level
    - GC content

### Ideas
- [ ] more artefacts
- [ ] find metric representative of patient
- [ ] COSMIC Peak arount mutation (Noushin idea)
- [ ] oncoKB likely oncogenic, predicted oncogenic: go back on this classification later on
- [ ] call again the IMPACT `.bam` files with a uniform caller to perform analysis



## Python
- [x] simplify cluster username, and ssh_remote_jobs path specification for `Selene_Job` class



## Roadmap

1. 🔬Try deep learning methods.  
2. 👀Compare both steps (artefact vs somatic and driver vs passenger) with existing methods.
3. 🌍Create a two-steps web-based classifier.  
4. 📃Write the paper!  





## temp
- Elsa's training
- `driver_classification/`
- previous and next base
- plot features importance
